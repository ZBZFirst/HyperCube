Decades of research, however, have found that by using perfluorocarbons, which are capable of holding high concentrations of critical gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, gas exchange optimal enough to support life is possible with no known toxic effects. The earliest method of liquid ventilation, tidal liquid breathing, involved infusion and active removal of tidal volumes of perfluorocarbons by a liquid ventilator for gas exchange. Recently, a new method of partial liquid breathing, called perfluorocarbon-associated gas exchange, makes the process of liquid ventilation simpler by using conventional gas ventilators. Current research is showing great promise in the use of liquid ventilation for patients with pulmonary pathology.

Liquid ventilation with oxygen-saturated perfluorocarbon liquid has been proposed as a method to eliminate alveolar surface tension; little is known about the interfacial tension between perfluorocarbon liquids and the lung lining layer. Premature and term newborn monkeys were treated from birth with a pressure-limited, time-cycled liquid ventilator using oxygenated perfluorocarbon liquids (APF-145 and perflubron).

MAIN FINDINGS: Despite its almost alien technology, perfluorocarbon tidal liquid breathing is an effective means to support respiration in normal and surfactant deficient lungs. A second, technique, perfluorocarbon associated gas exchange (PAGE), has recently been shown effective in normal lungs and in several animal models of lung disease. Both techniques appear to improve pulmonary function when pulmonary surface tension is elevated.

Substantial advances into the understanding of its pathophysiology and pathogenesis have been made and are reflected in new therapeutic interventions. Much current research is directed towards the role of prevention, exploring new approaches for accelerating lung maturation with combined maternal steroid and thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) therapy, surfactant replacement therapy, high frequency oscillatory ventilation, antioxidant administration, manipulation of endogenous antioxidants, and other pharmacologic strategies to minimize lung injury. The impact of other technologies, such as synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation, perfluorocarbon (liquid) ventilation, and perhaps inhaled nitric oxide therapy may become additional parts of the clinical regimen for some cases of severe neonatal respiratory failure. Less information is available on mechanisms which can hasten lung healing. Ongoing studies of inflammatory products, growth factors, and cytokines may lead to new therapies which will favorably influence the fibroproliferative phase of disease. In the meantime, the medical and social impact of BPD continues to remain a significant problem not only during infancy but also throughout life. Mildred Stahlman, MD, recently wrote that (a)s sanguine as the future looks for surfactant therapy, it may leave us with more very low-birth weight infants who survive, whose potential for normal pulmonary growth and development is unknown, and whose very immature organ systems, besides the lung, are still susceptible to metabolic, neurologic, and other problems. As more survivors are reaching young adulthood, respiratory and neurodevelopmental complications persist. Thus, as advances in the care of the premature newborn with respiratory distress have dramatically improved survival, the management of chronic lung disease and related problems remains a continuing challenge.","10.1016/s0031-3955(16)38726-0","https://doi.org/10.1016/s0031-3955(16)38726-0","","","Bronchodilator Agents","","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","","Cardiovascular Diseases","","Diuretics","","Humans","","Hypertension, Pulmonary","","Infant","","Infant, Newborn","","Lung","","Oxygen Inhalation Therapy","","Pulmonary Edema","","Respiration, Artificial","","Respiratory Tract Infections","","Steroids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to normal volume or pressure controlled artificial ventilation the treatment of lung failure sometimes requires new but accepted modes of ventilation as inversed ratio ventilation, permissive hypercapnea and high frequency ventilation. New methods as negative pressure ventilation, extracorporeal lung ventilation and liquid or partial liquid ventilation are not common yet and should be used only under special conditions. As a supplement of these modes of ventilation the application of prostacyclins, nitric oxide, surfactant and inhibitors of the arachidonic pathway is under clinical investigation.

Perflubron distribution, barotrauma, and inability to discern catheters were evaluated. RESULTS: Immediately after instillation of perflubron, opacification of more than two-thirds of the lungs was shown in 12 of 13 patients. A gravity-dependent distribution of perflubron was shown on 146 (95%) of 154 lateral radiographs. Perflubron gradually cleared until it filled less than one-third of the lungs 6.8 days later (range, 2-20 days). In the five survivors, minimal perflubron was visible up to 138 days. In five patients, perflubron increased the visibility of small pneumothoraces present before PLV. Location of intrathoracic catheters was obscured on 44 radiographs.

DESIGN: This study was a noncontrolled, phase I/II experimental study with a single group pretest/posttest design. SETTING: All studies were performed at a tertiary, pediatric referral hospital at the University of Michigan Medical School. PATIENTS: Six pediatric patients, from 8 wks to 5 1/2 yrs of age, with severe respiratory failure requiring ECLS to support gas exchange. INTERVENTIONS: After 2 to 9 days on ECLS, perfluorocarbon was administered into the trachea until the dependent zone of each lung was filled. The initial administered was 12.9 +/- 2.3 mL/kg (range 5 to 20). Gas ventilation of the perfluorocarbon-filled lungs (partial liquid ventilation) was then performed. The perfluorocarbon dose was repeated daily for a total of 3 to 7 days, with a cumulative dose of 45.2 +/- 6.1 mL/kg (range 30 to 72.5). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All measurements of native gas exchange were made during brief periods of discontinuation of ECLS and include PaO2 and the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, P(A-a)O2. Static pulmonary compliance, corrected for weight, was also measured directly. The mean PaO2 increased from 39 +/- 6 to 92 +/- 29 torr (5.2 +/- 0.8 to 12.2 +/- 3.9 kPa) over the 96 hrs after the initial dose (p = .021 by repeated-measures analysis of variance). The average P(A-a)O2 decreased from 635 +/- 10 to 499 +/- 77 torr (84.7 +/- 1.3 to 66.5 +/- 10.3 kPa) over the same time period (p = .059), while the mean static pulmonary compliance (normalized for patient weight) increased from 0.12 +/- 0.02 to 0.28 +/- 0.08 mL/cm H2O/kg (p = .01).

We then present our experience from the past 11 years in the most invasive, yet successful, therapy for acute respiratory failure-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). METHODS: Retrospective review of all patients treated with ECMO from September 1983 to December 1994 was undertaken. Data were collected from bedside ECMO flow sheets and the standardized data entry forms submitted to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization. All statistical analyses were performed using a standard statistical software program. RESULTS: During the study period, 194 neonates and 47 pediatric patients were treated with ECMO. The survival rate in the neonatal population is 82% and in the pediatric population it is 40%. The neonatal patients required an average of 153 hours of support while the pediatric patients required 220 hours (P = 0.008).

The M-number of several commonly used endotracheal and tracheostomy tubes is determined as a demonstration of the use of the M-number. Two nomograms are presented based on the M-number, and a description for their use in the clinical and laboratory settings is given.","10.3109/10731199809119771","https://doi.org/10.3109/10731199809119771","","","Adult","","Animals","","Biomechanical Phenomena","","Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation","","Fluorocarbons","","Humans","","Life Support Systems","","Respiration, Artificial","","Suction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mortality rate associated with CDH remains high due to the presence of associated anomalies, pulmonary hypoplasia, and pulmonary hypertension in those with adequate lung parenchyma to initially support life. A large number of approaches have been used to manage these infants, including delayed surgical repair, pharmacologic treatment of pulmonary hypertension, high frequency oscillation, ECMO, and surfactant therapy. New, and as yet unproven, innovations such as permissive hypercapnea, fetal surgery, and liquid ventilation may provide greater hope in the future for severely affected infants.

We describe the use of partial liquid ventilation as a lavage method following normal saline (NS) lavage in an infant with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) and severe hypoxemia. A 6 weeks old 3.4 kg former 36 weeks gestation boy on supplemental oxygen was transferred to our NICU with persistent tachypnea, dry cough, and increasing oxygen requirements. A lingular open lung biopsy revealed PAP. He developed progressive respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support, necessitating conventional NS lavage, followed by lung lavage with perflubron (LiquiVent; Alliance Pharmaceutical Corp. and Hoechst Marion Roussel) while on venovenous extracorporeal life support (ECLS). Lung lavage with NS and perflubron yielded minimal cloudy effluent. Gas exchange and pulmonary function deteriorated following NS lavage and attempts to discontinue ECLS were poorly tolerated. In contrast, tidal volume, PaO2, and pulmonary compliance increased after PLV, while the (A-a) D(O2) decreased to a point where ECLS was no longer required. Once perflubron was added repeatedly to the ventilator circuit to correct for evaporation over the 4 days of PLV. Cardiovascular status remained stable for several days; however, eventually he required reinitiation of ECLS and more mechanical ventilatory support with each trial off ECLS. He was maintained on high pressures and FiO2 without any possibility to wean him from mechanical ventilation. Life support was withdrawn 1 month after admission. The survival from PAP in infants remains dismal, even with total lung NS lavage. While both NS and perflubron lavage in this patient were not effective in removing the proteinaceous alveolar debris, PLV following NS lavage was associated with an improvement in gas exchange and lung compliance.","10.1002/(sici)1099-0496(199810)26:4<283::aid-ppul8>3.0.co;2-6","https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-0496(199810)26:4<283::aid-ppul8>3.0.co;2-6","","","Bronchoalveolar Lavage","","Emulsions","","Fluorocarbons","","Humans","","Hydrocarbons, Brominated","","Infant","","Life Support Care","","Male","","Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis","","Pulmonary Gas Exchange","","Respiration, Artificial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies have evaluated gas exchange and the safety of PLV in adult patients with severe respiratory failure whose gas exchange was partially provided by extracorporeal life support (ECLS). This is the first experience with adult patients who were not on ECLS. METHODS: Intratracheal perflubron in a total dose of 30.1 +/- 7.1 ml/kg was administered over a period of 45 +/- 9 hours to nine adult patients with mean age = 49 +/- 4 years and mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio = 128 +/- 7 as part of a prospective, multicenter, phase I-II noncontrolled trial. RESULTS: Significant decreases in mean (A-a)DO2 (baseline = 430 +/- 47, 48 hour = 229 +/- 17, p = 0.0127 by ANOVA) and FiO2 (baseline = 0.82 +/- 0.08, 48 hour = 0.54 +/- 0.06, p = 0.025), along with an increase in mean SvO2 (baseline = 75 +/- 3, 48 hour = 85 +/- 2, p = 0.018 by ANOVA) were observed. No significant changes in pulmonary compliance or hemodynamic variables were noted. Seven of the nine patients in this study survived beyond 28 days after initiation of partial liquid ventilation whereas 5 patients survived to discharge. Three adverse events [hypoxia (2) and hyperbilirubinemia (1)] were determined to be severe in nature. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that PLV may be performed safely with few related severe adverse effects.

There are many potential clinical applications of perfluorochemical (PFC) liquids that span many specialties in medicine. The ability to lower surface tension directed the initial clinical focus on neonatal therapy in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome. The first clinical trial of PFC ventilation was performed in neonates in 1989. Additional trials using LiquiVent, a medical-grade PFC liquid, were initiated in 1993 in infants, children, and adults with severe respiratory distress. Based on the results of several studies during this time, it was concluded that the technique of liquid ventilation seemed to be safe, improve lung function, and recruit lung volume in patients from these various populations. More than 100 patients from preterm neonates to elderly patients with respiratory distress have been studied. In general, patients experience improvement in lung function and oxygenation, without adverse events. The results of such trials are encouraging and suggest the feasibility of this technique in the neonate with severe respiratory failure requiring respiratory support. Limitations of the technique include a limited understanding of how it works and its effectiveness in different patient populations. It has also become evident that there is a need for additional diagnostic and therapeutic instrumentation to expedite its implementation in the intensive care environment. This article discusses clinical experiences with liquid ventilation and highlights the technical needs to facilitate its implementation in respiratory care management.","","","","","Adolescent","","Adult","","Aged","","Child","","Child, Preschool","","Clinical Trials as Topic","","Fluorocarbons","","Humans","","Infant","","Infant, Newborn","","Infant, Premature","","Life Support Care","","Middle Aged","","Pulmonary Gas Exchange","","Respiration, Artificial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The inflational time difference between the lung regions can lead to maldistribution of tidal gas and inefficient gas bubbling in the slow-inflating region during PLV. In this situation, increasing the inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio of the mechanical ventilator would lessen the heterogeneity of regional ventilation and improve gas exchange possibly to a greater degree than in gas ventilation (GV). DESIGN AND SETTING: Animal study at the Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Seoul, Korea Subjects: Eighteen rabbits (2.6 +/- 0.5 kg) with acute lung injury by saline solution lavage. INTERVENTIONS: Three I:E ratios were tried in GV and then in PLV. I:E ratios were changed by adjusting pause (1:2, 1:1, and 2:1; group 1) or by adjusting inspiratory flow rate (1:3, 1:1, and 2:1; group 2). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: With increasing I:E ratio in all animals, PaO(2)/FIO(2) increased (80 +/- 24, 143 +/- 74, and 147 +/- 88 mm Hg; p = 0.001), and PaCO(2) decreased (74 +/- 15, 66 +/- 16, and 66 +/- 15 mm Hg; p = 0.006). The increases of PaO(2)/FIO(2) from 1:2/1:3 to 1:1 (p = 0.006) and from 1:1 to 2:1 (p = 0.036) were both greater in group 1 than in group 2. PaCO(2) decreased with increasing I:E ratio in group 1, but not in group 2. The change of PaO(2)/FIO(2) by varying the I:E ratio was 49 +/- 65% in PLV and 14 +/- 14% in GV (p = 0.003).

We are probably in the period when better understanding of pulmonary pathophysiology enables the development of new technologies that can help in decreasing the morbidity and mortality of patients with respiratory failure. One of these unconventional methods is partial liquid ventilation (PLV). MAIN PURPOSE: The main aim of the study was to verify the possibility of treating potentially reversible respiratory failure in patients where extracorporeal life support (ECLS) was contraindicated and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) could not be used, or the patient had not met the criteria for ECMO. METHODS: PLV was used in 6 children totally, in 7 applications with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. Preoxygenated perfluorocarbon Rimar 101 (Miteni, Milan, Italy) warmed to 37 degrees C was applied intratracheally in the doses which corresponds with the functional residual capacity of lungs, the dose of perfluorocarbon was repeated every hour. Following parameters were recorded before, during and after PLV: pH, blood gases, ventilator setting, alveoloarterial difference for oxygen, dynamic compliance, and indices--oxygenation index and hypoxemia score (PaO2/FiO2). The values obtained 1 hour before PLV were compared with the values during PLV; the data before PLV and in the 3rd hour of PLV were evaluated statistically. RESULTS: Statistically significant increase of pH (7.22 vs 7.34, p < 0.05) and PaO2/FiO2 (72 vs 100 Torr, p < 0.01) and decrease of FiO2 (82% vs 64%, p < 0.05) and oxygenation index (23 vs 17, p < 0.05) occurred during 3 hours of PLV.

PATIENTS: Eighteen adult patients (mean +/- SEM age, 37.9 +/- 3.4 years) with severe respiratory failure, some of whom required extracorporeal life support (72%), and who were managed with partial liquid ventilation with perflubron. INTERVENTIONS: Perflubron was administered into the trachea, and gas ventilation of the perfluorocarbon-filled lung (partial liquid ventilation) was then performed. Additional doses were administered daily for from 1 to 7 days, with a median cumulative dose of 31 mL/kg (range, 3 to 60 mL/kg). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patient blood samples were evaluated by gas chromatography for serum perflubron levels. Sequential lateral and anteroposterior radiographs were assessed, using a 5-point rating scale, for the degree of perflubron fill following the final dose. Samples of expired gas were collected, and the rate of loss of perflubron in the expired gas was measured by gas chromatography. Mean serum perflubron levels increased to 0.16 +/- 0.05 mg/dL at 24 h following administration of the initial dose. A mean maximum level of 0.26 +/- 0.05 mg/dL of perflubron was present in the serum 24 h following the administration of the last dose. This level slowly trended downward to 0.18 +/- 0.06 mg/dL over the ensuing 7 days (p = 0.281). Perflubron elimination via expired gas occurred at a mean rate of 9.4 +/- 3.0 mL/h at 1 h, and 1.0 +/- 0.4 mL/h at 48 h after the last dose (p = 0.012). By radiologic evaluation, perflubron was eliminated from the lungs progressively from 4.2 +/- 0.2 at the time of administration of the last dose, to 2.8 +/- 0.3 at 4 days later (p < 0.001).

The authors, therefore, performed a prospective, randomized pilot study evaluating PLV and perfluorocarbon-induced lung growth (PILG) in newborns with CDH on extracorporeal life support (ECLS) at 6 medical centers. METHODS: Patients were selected randomly using a permuted block design to PLV/PILG (n = 8) or conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV/control, n = 5). Patients in the PILG group received daily doses which filled the lungs with perflubron for up to 7 days and were placed on continuous positive airway pressure of 5 to 8 cm H2O. CMV patients were treated with standard mechanical ventilation while on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). RESULTS: A total of 13 patients were evaluated in this study. All 3 patients enrolled without being on ECLS rapidly transitioned to ECLS. The study, therefore, effectively evaluated PILG (n = 8) versus standard ventilation (control, n = 5) on ECLS. Mean (+/- SE) gestational age was 37 +/- 1 weeks and weight was 3.1 +/- 0.1 kg. Time on ECMO was 9.8 +/- 2.3 days in the PILG and 14.5 +/- 3.5 days (P =.58) in the control group. Survival rate in the PILG group was 6 of 8 (75%), whereas survival rate was 2 of 5 (40%) in the control group (P =.50). The number of days free from the ventilator in the first 28 days (VFD) was 6.3 +/- 3.3 days with PILG and 4.6 +/- 4.6 days with control (P =.9). Causes of death in the PILG group included sepsis and renal failure in one patient and pulmonary hypertension in the other. There were no safety issues, and the deaths in the PILG group did not appear to be related to the administration of perflubron. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that PILG can be performed safely. The survival rate, VFD, and time on ECMO data, although not conclusive, are encouraging and indicate the need for a definitive trial of this novel intervention in these neonates with high mortality.","10.1053/jpsu.2003.50095","https://doi.org/10.1053/jpsu.2003.50095","","","Combined Modality Therapy","","Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation","","Female","","Fluorocarbons","","Hernia, Diaphragmatic","","Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital","","High-Frequency Ventilation","","Humans","","Hydrocarbons, Brominated","","Infant, Newborn","","Liquid Ventilation","","Lung","","Male","","Nitric Oxide","","Pilot Projects","","Prospective Studies","","Pulmonary Surfactants","","Respiration, Artificial","","Survival Rate","","Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For such patients, liquid ventilation (LV) with perfluorocarbon (PFC) liquids has been proposed. By eliminating the air-liquid interface in saccules (the premature gas exchange structures), where scarce or absent surfactant production exists, pulmonary instability is avoided, lung compliance is improved, and atelectatic saccules are recruited, ultimately lowering the saccular pressure. Tidal LV involves administrating a liquid tidal volume to the patient at each respiratory cycle, and therefore requires a dedicated circuital setup to deliver, withdraw, and refresh the PFC during the treatment. We have developed a prototype liquid breathing system (LBS). The apparatus comprises two subcircuits managed by a personal computer based control system. The ventilation subcircuit performs inspiration/expiration with two sets of peristaltic pumps. A system to evaluate the true inspired/expired volumes was devised that consists of two reservoirs equipped with pressure transducers measuring the hydraulic head of the fluid therein. Volume accuracy was +/- 0.3 ml. The refresh subcircuit properly processes the PFC by performing filtration (DFA, Pall, NY), oxygenation, CO2 scavenge, and heat exchange (SciMed 2500, Life Systems, MN). The new apparatus has been used in preliminary animal tests on five newborn mini pigs with induced acquired RDS. The PFC used was RM-101 (Miteni, Milano, Italy).

There have been no advances in preventing ARDS, but this review highlights strategies directed at minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury and other new adjunctive therapies in the care of these patients. RECENT FINDINGS: High-frequency oscillatory ventilation, airway pressure release ventilation, and partial liquid ventilation are potential protective ventilatory modes for children with ALI or ARDS. Recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, and kinetic therapy are all reported to improve oxygenation by opening the lung while positive end-expiratory pressure maintains functional residual capacity. Inhaled nitric oxide and surfactant are used to reduce inspired oxygen concentration and facilitate gas exchange, but their efficacy in ARDS continues to be investigated. Also, early investigations suggest that a specialized enteral formula can be a useful adjunctive therapy by reducing lung inflammation and improving oxygenation. When mechanical ventilation and adjunctive therapies fail, extracorporeal life support continues to be used as a rescue therapy. SUMMARY: It is likely that a combination of these therapies will maximize treatment and clinical outcomes in the future, but the only way that will be proven is through large controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients.","10.1097/01.mop.0000126602.23949.48","https://doi.org/10.1097/01.mop.0000126602.23949.48","","","Child","","Enteral Nutrition","","Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation","","High-Frequency Ventilation","","Humans","","Liquid Ventilation","","Nitric Oxide","","Prone Position","","Pulmonary Surfactants","","Respiratory Distress Syndrome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004; MEDLINE (1966 to May 2004); and CINAHL (1982 to May 2004); intensive care journals and conference proceedings; reference lists and unpublished literature. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials which compared partial liquid ventilation with other forms of ventilation, in adults (16 years old or greater) with ALI or ARDS, reporting one or more of the following: mortality; duration of mechanical ventilation, respiratory support, oxygen therapy, stay in the intensive care unit, or stay in hospital; infection; long term cognitive impairment or health related quality of life; long term lung function; or cost. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently evaluated the quality of the relevant studies and extracted the data from the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Problems with the inadequacy of the primary report of the one included study do not allow us to report any quantitative results for patients with ALI or ARDS. The only outcome we considered to be of clinical significance and reported for all enrolled patients (i.e., patients with ALI and ARDS and less severe respiratory insufficiency) was 28 day mortality. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for this outcome with a relative risk for 28 day mortality in the PLV group of 1.15 (95% confidence intervals of 0.64 to 2.10). REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence from randomized controlled trials to support or refute the use of partial liquid ventilation in adults with ALI or ARDS; adequately powered, high quality randomized controlled trials are still needed to assess its efficacy. Clinically relevant outcome measures should be assessed (especially mortality at discharge and later, duration of respiratory support and hospital stay, and long term cognitive and quality of life outcomes) and the studies should be published in full.","10.1002/14651858.CD003707.pub2","https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003707.pub2","","","Adult","","Humans","","Liquid Ventilation","","Morbidity","","Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","","Respiratory Distress Syndrome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Twenty-three patients aged younger than 2 yr were randomly assigned to receive either cisatracurium or vecuronium infusions postoperatively in a double-blinded fashion after undergoing congenital heart surgery. The infusion was titrated to maintain one twitch of a train-of-four. The times to full spontaneous recovery of train-of-four without fade, extubation, intensive care unit discharge, and hospital discharge were documented after drug discontinuation. Sparse sampling after termination of the infusion and a one-compartment model were used for pharmacokinetic analysis. The Mann-Whitney U test and Student t test were used to compare data between groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups with respect to demographic data or duration of postoperative neuromuscular blockade infusion. The median recovery time for train-of-four for cisatracurium (30 min) was less than that for vecuronium (180 min) (P < 0.05). Three patients in the vecuronium group had prolonged train-of-four recovery: Two had long elimination half-lives for vecuronium, and one had a high concentration of 3-OH vecuronium. There were no differences in extubation times, intensive care unit stays, or hospital stays between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results parallel data from adults demonstrating a markedly shorter recovery of neuromuscular transmission after cisatracurium compared with vecuronium. Decreased clearance of vecuronium and the accumulation of 3-OH vecuronium may contribute to prolonged spontaneous recovery times. Cisatracurium is associated with faster spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function compared with vecuronium but not with any differences in intermediate outcome measures in neonates and infants.","10.1097/00000542-200411000-00011","https://doi.org/10.1097/00000542-200411000-00011","","","Atracurium","","Biotransformation","","Cardiac Surgical Procedures","","Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid","","Double-Blind Method","","Half-Life","","Heart Defects, Congenital","","Humans","","Infant","","Infant, Newborn","","Intensive Care Units","","Length of Stay","","Monitoring, Intraoperative","","Neuromuscular Nondepolarizing Agents","","Synaptic Transmission","","Vecuronium Bromide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This indicates an increased level of oxidative damage somewhere in the body. The aim of this study was to determine whether the lung may be a site of increased oxidative damage following blood transfusions. This was achieved by examining the relationship between blood transfusion and levels of MDA in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from ventilated premature babies. The study was a retrospective analysis of data obtained from a group of 42 ventilated premature babies of less than 32 weeks' gestation. Twenty-seven babies received blood transfusions, and 9 received at least one transfusion during the first week of life when daily BAL samples were being taken. Pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (ELF) was sampled by BAL daily during the first week of life and weekly thereafter. MDA was measured by an established high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. There was a significant positive correlation between volume of blood transfusions received and peak and mean ELF MDA levels (r=0.810, peak; r=0.740, mean; n=21). During the first week of life, when daily samples were being taken, the mean ELF MDA level after blood transfusion (1.829 microM; SE, 0.529) was significantly greater than before transfusion (0.928 microM; SE, 0.297) (n=9). In babies who received 2 transfusions within the first week (n=5), the MDA level was elevated further following the second transfusion (2.825 microM; SE, 0.346). The results of this study indicate that pulmonary oxidative damage increases after the receipt of blood transfusions. Babies receiving blood transfusions show a greater incidence of pulmonary oxidative stress and poor clinical outcome. This may simply reflect that the sickest babies are those most in need of blood transfusion, and that there is no causal relationship. However, the possibility of a causal relationship between blood transfusions and oxidative damage exists and should be investigated.","10.1002/ppul.20190","https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.20190","","","Biomarkers","","Blood Transfusion","","Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid","","Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","","Gestational Age","","Humans","","Infant, Newborn","","Infant, Premature","","Infant, Premature, Diseases","","Lipid Peroxidation","","Lung","","Malondialdehyde","","Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care","","Respiration, Artificial","","Retrospective Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Severe, life-threatening amitraz intoxication in adults is very rarely recognized and reported. Described herein is a previously healthy 54-year-old patient who accidentally ingested a mouthful of liquid amitraz concentrate, and rapidly developed life-threatening clonidine-like overdose syndrome, manifested as nausea, vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia, bradypnoea, and deep coma. Supportive treatment, including mechanical ventilation, and atropine administration resulted in full recovery within 48 hr. Very few cases of near-fatal amitraz poisoning in adults have been described in the medical literature, leading to low awareness of physicians in general practice to the potential toxicity of amitraz. As a consequence, cases of amitraz poisoning are not recognised and therefore erroneously treated as the much more commonly recognized organophosphate and carbamate intoxication. In our discussion, we review the clinical and laboratory manifestations of amitraz poisoning, including clinical hints that aid in the recognition of this often-overlooked diagnosis. Differentiation of amitraz intoxication from the much more commonly seen pesticide-related organophosphate and carbamate intoxication is of utmost importance, in order to avoid erroneous, unnecessary, and often dangerous treatment.","10.1111/j.1742-7843.2005.pto_97399.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-7843.2005.pto_97399.x","","","Atropine","","Bradycardia","","Coma","","Diagnosis, Differential","","Humans","","Hyperglycemia","","Hypotension","","Insecticides","","Male","","Middle Aged","","Muscarinic Antagonists","","Poisoning","","Respiration, Artificial","","Toluidines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We recently demonstrated a survival to hospital discharge of 52% in this subset of patients. ECLS is capable of providing full respiratory and cardiac support, allowing time for the patient to recover from the underlying disease process. Additionally, ventilator settings are reduced to ""rest"" settings, avoiding the consequences of ventilator-induced lung injury that can contribute to a worse outcome. Systemic heparinization is a mainstay of ECLS therapy because of platelet activation in the circuit. Mechanical complications and significant bleeding can occur in up to one quarter of patients, requiring close attention and prompt intervention should they occur.

Percutaneous transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide is possible in the newborn human. Perfluorocarbon (PFC) liquids have excellent oxygen and carbon dioxide carrying capacity. Animals can breath immersed in perfluorocarbon liquids and maintain adequate gas exchange. Our hypothesis is that the combination of spontaneous tidal perfluorocarbon breathing and respiration through the skin immersed in perfluorocarbon will allow adequate gas exchange in the preterm newborn. In this pilot study we aimed to observe the effects of immersion in FC-77 perfluorocarbon liquid on the preterm lamb. PILOT DATA: Four preterm lambs at 100-115 days gestation were delivered using a modified EXIT procedure. Immediately after complete delivery, the catheterised lamb was immersed in warm, oxygenated FC-77 perfluorocarbon liquid. Physiological monitoring was done for up to 60 min. All lambs were warmed adequately and seemed to have centrally intact circulation initially. All had little or no respiratory effort and there was no appreciable lung expansion. All had severe respiratory acidosis. DISCUSSION: For the provision of immediate ex utero care to the 'fetus' there are three requirements: adequate gas exchange surfaces and sufficient oxygen and carbon dioxide gradients, a functioning circulation, and an environment capable of keeping the lamb warm (thus minimising metabolic demand, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production). In this pilot study the greatest initial problem was the severe and rapidly worsening respiratory acidosis. The major problem was a lack of respiratory drive. No lung expansion from the outset would yield zero contribution to gas exchange from the lungs. An intact central circulation does not necessarily mean that the pulmonary circulation, respiratory drive and/or the skin circulation are adequate. For adequate gas exchange to occur it will require a 'breathing' animal with expanded alveoli. If the transition from the normal in utero state to immersion in PFC was immediate, and lung expansion was achieved, it could still be possible to achieve adequate gas exchange through the skin and lungs of the extremely preterm newborn. HYPOTHESIS: Given the potential for gas exchange across the skin of the extremely preterm infant we hypothesise that the immersion of extremely preterm infants in PFC liquid will allow optimal percutaneous gas exchange to occur. Given some lung gas exchange with less injurious liquid ventilation (spontaneous or mechanical) we hypothesise that the combination of skin and lung gas exchange will provide sufficient gas exchange to support life.","10.1016/j.mehy.2008.02.005","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2008.02.005","","","Animals","","Animals, Newborn","","Female","","Fetus","","Fluorocarbons","","Gestational Age","","Humans","","Immersion","","Infant, Newborn","","Life Support Care","","Models, Biological","","Pregnancy","","Pulmonary Gas Exchange","","Sheep","","Skin Physiological Phenomena","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The real mechanism of lung liquid reabsorption and lung aereation at birth, in the past attributed only to the epithelial sodium channel function, has recently been linked to the first important breaths too and to the following changes in transpulmonary pressure. If this quite easily happens in the term baby, the preterm infants and all the babies with poor respiratory effort may have a delayed achievement of an adequate functional residual capacity (FRC). Premature delivery is always associated to the failure of respiratory transition and preterm babies frequently need a respiratory support (e.g., N-CPAP).

This project emerged from a request by the Health System Strategy Division of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care that MAS provide them with an evidentiary platform on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of COPD interventions. After an initial review of health technology assessments and systematic reviews of COPD literature, and consultation with experts, MAS identified the following topics for analysis: vaccinations (influenza and pneumococcal), smoking cessation, multidisciplinary care, pulmonary rehabilitation, long-term oxygen therapy, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute and chronic respiratory failure, hospital-at-home for acute exacerbations of COPD, and telehealth (including telemonitoring and telephone support). Evidence-based analyses were prepared for each of these topics. For each technology, an economic analysis was also completed where appropriate. In addition, a review of the qualitative literature on patient, caregiver, and provider perspectives on living and dying with COPD was conducted, as were reviews of the qualitative literature on each of the technologies included in these analyses.

For more information, please visit the THETA website: http://theta.utoronto.ca/static/contact. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this health technology assessment was to determine the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and safety of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION: Oxygen therapy is used in patients with COPD with hypoxemia, or very low blood oxygen levels, because they may have difficulty obtaining sufficient oxygen from inspired air. TECHNOLOGY: Long-term oxygen therapy is extended use of oxygen. Oxygen therapy is delivered as a gas from an oxygen source. Different oxygen sources are: 1) oxygen concentrators, electrical units delivering oxygen converted from room air; 2) liquid oxygen systems, which deliver gaseous oxygen stored as liquid in a tank; and 3) oxygen cylinders, which contain compressed gaseous oxygen. All are available in portable versions. Oxygen is breathed in through a nasal cannula or through a mask covering the mouth and nose. The treating clinician determines the flow rate, duration of use, method of administration, and oxygen source according to individual patient needs. Two landmark randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with COPD established the role of LTOT in COPD. Questions regarding the use of LTOT, however, still remain. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and safety of LTOT compared with no LTOT in patients with COPD, who are stratified by severity of hypoxemia? RESEARCH METHODS: LITERATURE SEARCH: SEARCH STRATEGY: A literature search was performed on September 8, 2010 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and INAHTA for studies published from January 1, 2007 to September 8, 2010. A single clinical epidemiologist reviewed the abstracts, obtained full-text articles for studies meeting the eligibility criteria, and examined reference lists for additional relevant studies not identified through the literature search. A second clinical epidemiologist and then a group of epidemiologists reviewed articles with an unknown eligibility until consensus was established. INCLUSION CRITERIA: patients with mild, moderate, or severe hypoxemia; English-language articles published between January 1, 2007 and September 8, 2010; journal articles reporting on effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, or safety for the comparison of interest; clearly described study design and methods; health technology assessments, systematic reviews, RCTs, or prospective cohort observational studies; any type of observational study for the evaluation of safety. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: no hypoxemia; non-English papers; animal or in vitro studies; case reports, case series, or case-case studies; studies comparing different oxygen therapy regimens; studies on nocturnal oxygen therapy; studies on short-burst, palliative, or ambulatory oxygen (supplemental oxygen during exercise or activities of daily living). OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: mortality/survival; hospitalizations; readmissions; forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1); forced vital capacity (FVC). FEV1/FVC; pulmonary hypertension; arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2); arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2); end-exercise dyspnea score; endurance time; health-related quality of life. Note: Outcomes of interest were formulated according to existing studies, with arterial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide as surrogate outcomes. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: CONCLUSIONS: Based on low quality of evidence, LTOT (~ 15 hours/day) decreases all-cause mortality in patients with COPD who have severe hypoxemia (PaO2 ~ 50 mm Hg) and heart failure. The effect for all-cause mortality had borderline statistical significance when the control group was no LTOT: one study. Based on low quality of evidence, there is no beneficial effect of LTOT on all-cause mortality at 3 and 7 years in patients with COPD who have mild-to-moderate hypoxemia (PaO2 ~ 59-65 mm Hg). Based on very low quality of evidence, there is some suggestion that LTOT may have a beneficial effect over time on FEV1 and PaCO2 in patients with COPD who have severe hypoxemia and heart failure: improved methods are needed. Based on very low quality of evidence, there is no beneficial effect of LTOT on lung function or exercise factors in patients with COPD who have mild-to-moderate hypoxemia, whether survivors or nonsurvivors are assessed. Based on low to very low quality of evidence, LTOT does not prevent readmissions in patients with COPD who have severe hypoxemia. Limited data suggest LTOT increases the risk of hospitalizations. Limited work has been performed evaluating the safety of LTOT by severity of hypoxemia. Based on low to very low quality of evidence, LTOT may have a beneficial effect over time on health-related quality of life in patients with COPD who have severe hypoxemia. Limited work using disease-specific instruments has been performed. Ethical constraints of not providing LTOT to eligible patients with COPD prohibit future studies from examining LTOT outcomes in an ideal way.","","","PMC3384376","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3384376/","Cost-Benefit Analysis","","Evidence-Based Medicine","","Humans","","Oxygen Inhalation Therapy","","Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive","","Technology Assessment, Biomedical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Artifical ventilatory support is commonly required and may exacerbate lung injury. Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) has been proposed as a less injurious form of ventilatory support for these patients. Although PLV has been shown to improve gas exchange and to reduce inflammation in experimental models of ALI, a previous systematic review did not find any evidence to support or refute its use in humans with ALI and ARDS. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review was to assess whether PLV reduced mortality (at 28 d, at discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU), at discharge from hospital and at one, two and five years) in adults with ALI or ARDS when compared with conventional ventilatory support.Secondary objectives were to determine how PLV compared with conventional ventilation with regard to duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of respiratory support, duration of oxygen therapy, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, incidence of infection, long-term cognitive impairment, long-term health related quality of life, long- term lung function, long-term morbidity costs and adverse events. The following adverse events were considered: hypoxia (arterial PO2 <80 mm Hg), pneumothorax (any air leak into the pleural space requiring therapeutic intervention), hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg sustained for longer than two minutes or requiring treatment with fluids or vasoactive drugs), bradycardia (heart rate < 50 beats per minute sustained for longer than one minute or requiring therapeutic intervention) and cardiac arrest (absence of effective cardiac output). SEARCH METHODS: In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 10, 2012, in The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1966 to November 2012); EMBASE (Ovid SP, 1980 to November 2012) and CINAHL (EBSCOhost,1982 to November 2012) for published studies. In our original review, we searched until May 2004.Grey literature was identified by searching conference proceedings and trial registries and by contacting experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: As in the original review, review authors selected randomized controlled trials that compared PLV with other forms of ventilation in adults (16 y of age or older) with ALI or ARDS, reporting one or more of the following: mortality; duration of mechanical ventilation, respiratory support, oxygen therapy, stay in the intensive care unit or stay in hospital; infection; long-term cognitive impairment or health-related quality of life; long-term lung function or cost. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently evaluated the quality of the relevant studies and extracted the data from included studies. MAIN RESULTS: In this updated review, one new eligible study was identified and included, yielding a total of two eligible studies (including a combined total of 401 participants). Of those 401 participants, 170 received 'high'-dose partial liquid ventilation (i.e. a mean dose of at least 20 mL/kg), 99 received 'low-dose' partial liquid ventilation (i.e. a dose of 10 mL/kg) and 132 received conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV). Pooled estimates of effect were calculated for all those who received 'high'-dose PLV versus conventional ventilation. No evidence indicated that 'high'-dose PLV either reduced mortality at 28 d (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.85, P = 0.37) or increased the number of days free of CMV at 28 d (mean difference (MD) -2.24, 95% CI -4.71 to 0.23, P = 0.08). The pooled estimate of effect for bradycardia in those who received PLV was significantly greater than in those who received CMV (RR 2.51, 95% CI 1.31 to 4.81, P = 0.005). Pooled estimates of effect for the following adverse events- hypoxia, pneumothorax, hypotension and cardiac arrest- all showed a nonsignificant trend towards a higher occurrence of these events in those treated with PLV. Because neither eligible study addressed morbidity or mortality beyond 28 d, it was not possible to determine the effect of PLV on these outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No evidence supports the use of PLV in ALI or ARDS; some evidence suggests an increased risk of adverse events associated with its use.","10.1002/14651858.CD003707.pub3","https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003707.pub3","PMC6516802","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6516802/","Acute Lung Injury","","Adult","","Humans","","Liquid Ventilation","","Morbidity","","Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","","Respiratory Distress Syndrome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent imaging studies indicate that lung aeration and functional residual capacity (FRC) recruitment results from inspiratory efforts, which create transpulmonary pressure gradients. During inspiration, these pressure gradients drive airway liquid movement through the conducting and into the distal airways where it crosses the pulmonary epithelium and enters the surrounding tissue. Although this process can occur rapidly (within 3-5 breaths), liquid clearance from lung tissue is much slower, resulting in oedema and increased interstitial tissue pressures, facilitating liquid re-entry into the airways at FRC. Whereas this liquid may be cleared during the next inspiration, liquid re-entry at FRC can be opposed by Na(+) reabsorption, oncotic pressures and expiratory braking manoeuvres. Recognition that transpulmonary pressure gradients mainly drive airway liquid clearance at birth has provided a clearer understanding of how this process may be facilitated in very preterm infants. In particular, it underpins the rationale for providing respiratory support that initially focuses on moving liquid through tubes (airways) rather than air. As the viscosity of liquid is much greater than air, the resistance to moving liquid is ≈ 100 times greater than air, necessitating the use of higher pressures or longer inflation times. Although it is unclear how this strategy could be safely applied clinically, it is clear that end-expiratory pressures are required to create and maintain FRC in preterm infants.","10.1016/j.siny.2013.08.011","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.siny.2013.08.011","","","Functional Residual Capacity","Airway liquid clearance","Humans","Functional residual capacity","Infant, Newborn","Lung aeration","Infant, Premature","Positive end-expiratory pressure","Positive-Pressure Respiration","Preterm birth","Respiration","Pulmonary ventilation","Respiration, Artificial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This report from the Swedish STRIDA project describes analytically confirmed non-fatal intoxications involving butyrfentanyl (butyrylfentanyl) or 4-fluorobutyrfentanyl (para-fluorobutyrfentanyl), two fentanyl analogues recently introduced as NPS opioids. STUDY DESIGN: Observational case series of consecutive patients with suspected acute NPS exposure and requiring hospital care from all over Sweden. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From May 2014 to January 2015, blood and urine samples were obtained from four intoxication cases involving butyrfentanyl and one case involving 4-fluorobutyrfentanyl (men, 19-30 years) presenting in emergency departments (ED) or intensive care units (ICU). Laboratory analysis of serum and/or urine samples was performed by multi-component liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. Data on clinical features were collected during consultations with the Poisons Information Centre and retrieved from medical records. CASE DETAILS: Of the five patients, two were discharged home from the ED and three were admitted to the ICU, of whom two required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Clinical features included typical opioid symptoms such as unconsciousness, respiratory depression, and apnea. In one case, naloxone successfully countered the effects. All patients were discharged the same or the following day. Butyrfentanyl was detected in two serum (0.6 and 0.9 ng/mL) and three urine (2.0-65.6 ng/mL) samples from three of four cases; three cases also contained fentanyl. In the 4-fluorobutyrfentanyl case, the substance was detected in serum (∼15 ng/mL) and urine (∼10 ng/mL). In four cases, other NPS and/or classical drugs were also detected. Analysis of two ""butyrfentanyl"" NPS products (nasal spray and powder) brought to hospital by patients showed that the 10-fold more potent fentanyl was the main active ingredient (∼7.5-10-fold higher amount) in both. CONCLUSION: Typical and potentially life-threatening opioid toxicity was seen in acute intoxications involving butyrfentanyl, 4F-butyrfentanyl, and fentanyl. The incorrect labelling of butyrfentanyl NPS products which instead mainly contained fentanyl is alarming, given the narrow range between a safe and a lethal dose for opioids.","10.3109/15563650.2015.1054505","https://doi.org/10.3109/15563650.2015.1054505","","","Adult","Butyrfentanyl","Analgesics, Opioid","Butyrylfentanyl","Apnea","Fentanyl analogue","Chromatography, Liquid","Internet drugs","Dose-Response Relationship, Drug","Mass spectrometry methods","Emergency Service, Hospital","NPS","Fentanyl","New psychoactive substances","Humans","Opioid analgesic drug","Illicit Drugs","para-Fluorobutyrfentanyl","Intensive Care Units","","Male","","Mass Spectrometry","","Naloxone","","Respiratory Insufficiency","","Retrospective Studies","","Sweden","","Unconsciousness","","Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite off-label administration, dexmedetomidine has found a niche in critically ill neonates and infants with congenital heart disease because of its minimal effects on respiratory function at sedative doses, facilitating early extubation and fast-track postoperative care. There are little pharmacokinetic data regarding newborns who have immature drug metabolizing capacity and who are at risk for reduced dexmedetomidine clearance and drug toxicity. The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine in neonates and infants after open heart surgery. This study included 23 evaluable neonates (age, 1 day-1 month) and 36 evaluable infants (age, 1 month-24 months) after open heart surgery. METHODS: Full-term neonates and infants requiring mechanical ventilation after open heart surgery received dexmedetomidine in a dose-escalation study. Dexmedetomidine was administered as a loading dose over 10 minutes followed by a continuous IV infusion up to 24 hours. Cohorts of 12 infants were enrolled sequentially to receive 0.35, 0.7, or 1 μg/kg dexmedetomidine followed by 0.25, 0.5, or 0.75 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine, respectively. Cohorts of 9 neonates received 0.25, 0.35, or 0.5 μg/kg dexmedetomidine followed by 0.2, 0.3, or 0.4 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine, respectively. Plasma dexmedetomidine concentrations were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. A population nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach was used to characterize dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic parameters of dexmedetomidine were estimated using a 2-compartment disposition model with weight allometrically scaled as a covariate on drug clearance, intercompartmental clearance, central and peripheral volume of distributions and age, total bypass time, and intracardiac shunting on clearance. Dexmedetomidine demonstrated a plasma drug clearance of 657 × (weight/70) mL/min, intercompartmental clearance of 6780 × (weight/70) mL/min, central volume of distribution of 88 × (weight/70) L and peripheral volume of distribution of 112 × (weight/70) L for a typical subject with age >1 month with a cardiopulmonary bypass time of 60 minutes and without right-to-left intracardiac shunt. Dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetics may be influenced by age during the neonatal period, weight, total bypass time, and presence of intracardiac shunt. CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine clearance is significantly diminished in full-term newborns and increases rapidly in the first few weeks of life. The dependence of clearance on age during the first few weeks of life reflects the relative immaturity of metabolic processes during the newborn period. Continuous infusions of up to 0.3 μg/kg/h in neonates and 0.75 μg/kg/h in infants were well tolerated after open heart surgery.","10.1213/ANE.0000000000000869","https://doi.org/10.1213/ANE.0000000000000869","","","Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists","","Age Factors","","Analgesics, Non-Narcotic","","Cardiac Surgical Procedures","","Child, Preschool","","Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid","","Computer Simulation","","Dexmedetomidine","","Drug Administration Schedule","","Drug Dosage Calculations","","Drug Monitoring","","Heart Defects, Congenital","","Humans","","Hypnotics and Sedatives","","Infant","","Infant, Newborn","","Infusions, Intravenous","","Metabolic Clearance Rate","","Models, Biological","","Monte Carlo Method","","Nonlinear Dynamics","","Respiration, Artificial","","Tandem Mass Spectrometry","","Term Birth","","Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: University-affiliated teaching hospital. PATIENTS: The study was performed in 30 consecutive patients undergoing major abdominal or thoracic surgery. They were aged 18 to 65 years and graded as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II. All patients were scheduled to require more than 6 hours of postoperative sedation and mechanical ventilation. Nine of the patients had low plasma albumin levels (<35 g/L but >24 g/L; male/female, 6/3) after the operation, who were assigned to hypoalbuminemia group, and the remainder with normoalbuminemia (>35 g/L; male/female, 15/6) were assigned to normoalbuminemia group. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were administered a loading dose of dexmedetomidine 1.0 μg/kg infused over 10 minutes after admitted into intensive care unit and a maintenance dose of 0.4 μg/kg per hour followed for 6 hours. MEASUREMENTS: Plasma dexmedetomidine levels were determined by high performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrum. Sedation was evaluated using Ramsay sedation score. Heart rate and arterial pressures were monitored. Adverse events were recorded. MAIN RESULTS: Compared with patients with normoalbuminemia, maximum plasma concentration of dexmedetomidine decreased by 21.2% in patients with hypoalbuminemia (P < .01). Its volume of distribution at steady state increased by 40.5%; elimination half-life decreased by 33.5% (P < .01). However, heart rates, arterial pressures, and Ramsay sedation scores did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. No serious adverse events occurred in either the patients with hypoalbuminemia or normoalbuminemia. CONCLUSIONS: Sedation and adverse reactions of dexmedetomidine infusion did not differ significantly between patients with mild hypoalbuminemia and normoalbuminemia, although its volume of distribution at steady state increased and elimination half-life shortened in patients with hypoalbuminemia. This suggests that dexmedetomidine infusion can safely be used in mild hypoalbuminemia patients after major abdominal or thoracic surgery.","10.1016/j.jclinane.2015.06.002","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinane.2015.06.002","","","Abdomen","Abdominal surgery","Adolescent","Dexmedetomidine","Adult","Hypoalbuminemia","Aged","Pharmacodynamics","Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid","Pharmacokinetics","Cohort Studies","Thoracic surgery","Dexmedetomidine","","Female","","Half-Life","","Hospitals, University","","Humans","","Hypnotics and Sedatives","","Hypoalbuminemia","","Intensive Care Units","","Male","","Mass Spectrometry","","Middle Aged","","Prospective Studies","","Respiration, Artificial","","Thoracic Surgical Procedures","","Tissue Distribution","","Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CASE DETAILS: A 27-year-old man, presented with deep coma, bilateral pinpoint unreactive pupils, acute respiratory failure and hypotension, complicated by hypoxic ischemic changes in the central nervous system. A positive result of a urine screening test confirmed the presence of benzodiazepines, which resulted in administration of flumazenil and improved patient consciousness. Quantitative method of liquid chromatography indicated flubromazolam in the patient's serum at 59 ng/mL and urine at 105 ng/mL about 19 h after ingestion of 3 mg dose. On admission, serum creatine kinase was 15,960 U/L. The patient was treated with mechanical ventilation, intravenous fluids, flumazenil and continuous infusion of norepinephrine at a dose of 0.12 µg/kg/min.

This report from the Swedish STRIDA project describes analytically confirmed cases of intoxication involving the fentanyl analogs acetylfentanyl, 4-methoxybutyrfentanyl, and furanylfentanyl. METHODS: Patients with suspected NPS exposure presenting in emergency departments and intensive care units in Sweden and requiring hospital care are invited to the STRIDA project. Toxicological analysis of serum and urine samples was performed by multi-component liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric methods. Data on clinical features were retrieved from telephone consultations with the Swedish Poisons Information Centre and from medical records. RESULTS: Between April and November 2015, 14 analytically confirmed intoxications involving acetylfentanyl (nine cases), 4-methoxybutyrfentanyl (3), furanylfentanyl (1), and 4-methoxybutyrfentanyl together with furanylfentanyl (1) were identified. The patients were aged 20-40 (mean 28.5) years and 86% were men. Twelve patients (86%) were admitted to intensive care, where two required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Typical clinical features were decreased consciousness, respiratory depression, and miosis. In eight cases, the antidote naloxone was administered to counter the effects. The serum acetylfentanyl concentration (N = 7) was 0.6-51.6 (mean 18.3 and median 14.8) ng/mL, and in urine (N = 8) 0.1-686 (mean 155 and median 66.6) ng/mmol creatinine. The serum 4-methoxybutyrfentanyl concentration (N = 2) was 1.3 and 3.1 ng/mL, and 5.1-51.3 ng/mmol creatinine in urine (N = 3). For furanylfentanyl, the serum concentrations were 4.4 and 148 ng/mL and in urine 9.2 and 85 ng/mmol creatinine, respectively. In 13 cases (93%), other NPS and/or classical drugs were also detected. Drug products brought to hospital by patients contained acetylfentanyl (nasal spray and pink tablet), 4-methoxybutyrfentanyl (green tablet), furanylfentanyl/traces of 4-methoxybutyrfentanyl (nasal spray), and 4-fluorobutyrfentanyl (purple tablet).

In addition, the continuing efforts to better define the disease origin, progression and pathology by basic scientists and clinicians contributes to insights in the basic principles of lung biology. However, the use of different model systems, experimental approaches and readout systems may generate somewhat conflicting or contradictory results. In an effort to summarize the latest developments in the lung epithelial stem cell biology, we provide an overview of the current status of the field. We first describe the different stem cells, or progenitor cells, residing in the homeostatic lung. Next, we focus on the plasticity of the different cell types upon several injury-induced activation or repair models, and highlight the regenerative capacity of lung cells. Lastly, we summarize the generation of lung mimics, such as air-liquid interface cultures, organoids and lung on a chip, that are required to test emerging hypotheses. Moreover, the increasing collaboration between distinct specializations will contribute to the eventual development of an artificial lung device capable of assisting reduced lung function and capacity in human patients.","10.1186/s12931-016-0358-z","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-016-0358-z","PMC4842297","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842297/","Animals","Lung","Bioartificial Organs","Lung mimics","Biomimetics","Regeneration","Humans","Stem cells","Lung","Tissue engineering","Lung Transplantation","","Regeneration","","Respiration, Artificial","","Stem Cell Transplantation","","Stem Cells","","Tissue Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When the lung is ventilated with a breathable perfluorocarbon liquid, the inspired perfluorocarbon allows us to control efficiently the cooling process of the organs. While TLV can rapidly cool animals, the cooling speed in humans remains unknown. The objective is to predict the efficiency and safety of ultrafast cooling by TLV in adult humans. METHODS: It is based on a previously published thermal model of ovines in TLV and the design of a direct optimal controller to compute the inspired perfluorocarbon temperature profile. The experimental results in an adult sheep are presented. The thermal model of sheep is subsequently projected to a human model to simulate the optimal hypothermia induction and its sensitivity to physiological parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: The results in the sheep showed that the computed inspired perfluorocarbon temperature command can avoid arterial temperature undershoot. The projection to humans revealed that mild hypothermia should be ultrafast (reached in fewer than 3 min (-72 °C/h) for the brain and 20 min (-10 °C/h) for the entire body). CONCLUSION: The projection to human model allows concluding that therapeutic hypothermia induction by TLV can be ultrafast and safe. SIGNIFICANCE: This study is the first to simulate ultrafast cooling by TLV in a human model and is a strong motivation to translate TLV to humans to improve the quality of life of postcardiac arrest patients.","10.1109/TBME.2017.2671741","https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2017.2671741","","","Adult","","Animals","","Brain","","Computer Simulation","","Fluorocarbons","","Heart Arrest","","Humans","","Hypothermia, Induced","","Liquid Ventilation","","Lung","","Models, Biological","","Sheep","","Temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mechanisms underlying subglottic colonization in critical illness have not been defined, limiting strategies for targeted prevention of VAP. OBJECTIVES: To characterize subglottic host defense dysfunction in mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU; to determine whether subglottic mucin contributes to neutrophil phagocytic impairment and bacterial growth. METHODS: Prospective subglottic sampling in mechanically ventilated patients (intubated for four or more days), and newly intubated control patients (intubated for less than 30 min); isolation and culture of primary subglottic epithelial cells from control patients; laboratory analysis of host innate immune defenses. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-four patients in the ICU and 27 newly intubated control patients were studied. Subglottic ICU samples had significantly reduced microbiological diversity and contained potential respiratory pathogens. The subglottic microenvironment in the ICU was characterized by neutrophilic inflammation, significantly increased proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophil proteases, and altered physical properties of subglottic secretions, including accumulation of mucins. Subglottic mucin from ICU patients impaired the capacity of neutrophils to phagocytose and kill bacteria. Phagocytic impairment was reversible on treatment with a mucolytic agent. Subglottic mucus promoted growth and invasion of bacterial pathogens in a novel air-liquid interface model of primary human subglottic epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical ventilation in the ICU is characterized by substantial mucin secretion and neutrophilic inflammation. Mucin impairs neutrophil function and promotes bacterial growth. Mucolytic agents reverse mucin-mediated neutrophil dysfunction. Enhanced mucus disruption and removal has potential to augment preventive benefits of subglottic drainage.","10.1164/rccm.201709-1819OC","https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201709-1819OC","","","Adult","critical care","Aged","mucoproteins","Critical Illness","neutrophils","Female","phagocytosis","Glottis","ventilator-associated pneumonia","Humans","","Immunity, Innate","","Inflammation","","Male","","Middle Aged","","Mucins","","Neutrophils","","Prospective Studies","","Respiration, Artificial","","Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite improvements in clinical management (for example, lung protection strategies), mortality in this patient group is at approximately 40%. This is an update of a previous version of this review, last published in 2004. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacological agents in adults with ARDS on mortality, mechanical ventilation, and fitness to return to work at 12 months. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL on 10 December 2018. We searched clinical trials registers and grey literature, and handsearched reference lists of included studies and related reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pharmacological agents with control (placebo or standard therapy) to treat adults with established ARDS. We excluded trials of nitric oxide, inhaled prostacyclins, partial liquid ventilation, neuromuscular blocking agents, fluid and nutritional interventions and medical oxygen. We excluded studies published earlier than 2000, because of changes to lung protection strategies for people with ARDS since this date. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 48 RCTs with 6299 participants who had ARDS; two included only participants with mild ARDS (also called acute lung injury). Most studies included causes of ARDS that were both direct and indirect injuries. We noted differences between studies, for example the time of administration or the size of dose, and because of unclear reporting we were uncertain whether all studies had used equivalent lung protection strategies.We included five types of agents as the primary comparisons in the review: corticosteroids, surfactants, N-acetylcysteine, statins, and beta-agonists. We included 15 additional agents (sivelestat, mesenchymal stem cells, ulinastatin, anisodimine, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, recombinant human ACE2 (palifermin), AP301, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), levosimendan, prostacyclins, lisofylline, ketaconazole, nitroglycerins, L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (OTZ), and penehyclidine hydrochloride).We used GRADE to downgrade outcomes for imprecision (because of few studies and few participants), for study limitations (e.g. high risks of bias) and for inconsistency (e.g. differences between study data).Corticosteroids versus placebo or standard therapyCorticosteroids may reduce all-cause mortality within three months by 86 per 1000 patients (with as many as 161 fewer to 19 more deaths); however, the 95% confidence interval (CI) includes the possibility of both increased and reduced deaths (risk ratio (RR) 0.77, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.05; 6 studies, 574 participants; low-certainty evidence). Due to the very low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain whether corticosteroids make little or no difference to late all-cause mortality (later than three months) (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.52; 1 study, 180 participants), or to the duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference (MD) -4.30, 95% CI -9.72 to 1.12; 3 studies, 277 participants). We found that ventilator-free days up to day 28 (VFD) may be improved with corticosteroids (MD 4.09, 95% CI 1.74 to 6.44; 4 studies, 494 participants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication, or fitness to return to work at 12 months (FTR).Surfactants versus placebo or standard therapyWe are uncertain whether surfactants make little or no difference to early mortality (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.29; 9 studies, 1338 participants), or whether they reduce late all-cause mortality (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.61; 1 study, 418 participants). Similarly, we are uncertain whether surfactants reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (MD -2.50, 95% CI -4.95 to -0.05; 1 study, 16 participants), make little or no difference to VFD (MD -0.39, 95% CI -2.49 to 1.72; 2 studies, 344 participants), or to adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.44; 2 studies, 88 participants). We are uncertain of these effects because we assessed them as very low-certainty. No studies reported FTR.N-aceytylcysteine versus placeboWe are uncertain whether N-acetylcysteine makes little or no difference to early mortality, because we assessed this as very low-certainty evidence (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.30; 1 study, 36 participants). No studies reported late all-cause mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, VFD, adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation, or FTR.Statins versus placeboStatins probably make little or no difference to early mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.26; 3 studies, 1344 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or to VFD (MD 0.40, 95% CI -0.71 to 1.52; 3 studies, 1342 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Statins may make little or no difference to duration of mechanical ventilation (MD 2.70, 95% CI -3.55 to 8.95; 1 study, 60 participants; low-certainty evidence). We could not include data for adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation in one study because it was unclearly reported. No studies reported late all-cause mortality or FTR.Beta-agonists versus placebo controlBeta-blockers probably slightly increase early mortality by 40 per 1000 patients (with as many as 119 more or 25 fewer deaths); however, the 95% CI includes the possibility of an increase as well as a reduction in mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.42; 3 studies, 646 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Due to the very low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain whether beta-agonists increase VFD (MD -2.20, 95% CI -3.68 to -0.71; 3 studies, 646 participants), or make little or no difference to adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation (one study reported little or no difference between groups, and one study reported more events in the beta-agonist group). No studies reported late all-cause mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or FTR. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found insufficient evidence to determine with certainty whether corticosteroids, surfactants, N-acetylcysteine, statins, or beta-agonists were effective at reducing mortality in people with ARDS, or duration of mechanical ventilation, or increasing ventilator-free days. Three studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of this review. As the potential long-term consequences of ARDS are important to survivors, future research should incorporate a longer follow-up to measure the impacts on quality of life.","10.1002/14651858.CD004477.pub3","https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004477.pub3","PMC6646953","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6646953/","Adrenal Cortex Hormones","","Adult","","Humans","","Neuromuscular Blocking Agents","","Pulmonary Surfactants","","Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","","Respiration, Artificial","","Respiratory Distress Syndrome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this experimental study was to compare their in vitro characteristics and in vivo effects in the improvement of pulmonary function and protection of lung injury. The biophysical properties, ultrastructure, and lipid composition of both surfactant preparations were respectively analysed in vitro by means of Langmuir-Blodgett trough (LBT), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry (LC-MS). Then, as core pharmacological activity, both head-to-head (100 and 200 mg/kg for both surfactants) and licensed dose comparisons (70 mg/kg Calsurf vs. 200 mg/kg Poractant alfa) between the two surfactants were conducted as prophylaxis in preterm rabbits with primary surfactant deficiency, assessing survival time and rate and dynamic compliance of the respiratory system (Cdyn). Intrapulmonary surfactant pools, morphometric volume density as alveolar expansion (Vv), and lung injury scores were determined post mortem. AFM and LC-MS analysis revealed qualitative differences in the ultrastructure as well as in the lipid composition of both preparations. Calsurf showed a longer plateau region of the LBT isotherm and lower film compressibility. In vivo, both surfactant preparations improved Cdyn at any dose, although maximum benefits in terms of Vv and intrapulmonary surfactant pools were seen with the 200 mg/kg dose in both surfactants. The group of animals treated with 200 mg/kg of Poractant alfa showed a prolonged survival time and rate compared to untreated but ventilated controls, and significantly ameliorated lung injury compared to Calsurf at any dose, including 200 mg/kg. The overall outcomes suggest the pulmonary effects to be dose dependent for both preparations. The group of animals treated with 200 mg/kg of Poractant alfa showed a significant reduction of mortality. Compared to Calsurf, Poractant alfa exerted better effects if licensed doses were compared, which requires further investigation.","10.1371/journal.pone.0230229","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230229","PMC7069639","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7069639/","Animals","","Biological Products","","China","","Humans","","Infant, Newborn","","Infant, Premature","","Lung","","Phospholipids","","Pulmonary Surfactants","","Rabbits","","Respiration, Artificial","","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn","","Swine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transient tachypnoea typically appears within the first two hours of life in term and late preterm newborns. The administration of corticosteroids might compensate for the impaired hormonal changes which occur when infants are delivered late preterm, or at term but before the onset of spontaneous labour (elective caesarean section). Corticosteroids might improve the clearance of liquid from the lungs, thus reducing the effort required to breathe and improving respiratory distress. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to assess whether postnatal corticosteroids - compared to placebo, no treatment or any other drugs administered to treat TTN - are effective and safe in the treatment of TTN in infants born at 34 weeks' gestational age or more. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1996 to 19 February 2019), Embase (1980 to 19 February 2019) and CINAHL (1982 to 19 February 2019). We applied no language restrictions. We searched clinical trial registries for ongoing studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized controlled trials and cluster-randomized trials comparing postnatal corticosteroids versus placebo or no treatment or any other drugs administered to infants born at 34 weeks' gestational age or more and less than three days of age with TTN. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For each of the included trials, two review authors independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, duration of oxygen therapy, need for continuous positive airway pressure, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, etc.) and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomization and blinding, completeness of follow-up). The primary outcomes considered in this review were need for nasal continuous positive airway pressure and need for mechanical ventilation. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: One trial, which included 49 infants, met the inclusion criteria. The trial compared the use of inhaled corticosteroids (budesonide) with placebo. We found no differences between groups in terms of need for nasal continuous positive airway pressure (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 2.51; 1 study, 49 participants) and need for mechanical ventilation (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.38; 1 study, 49 participants). The type of mechanical ventilation used in the included study was high-frequency oscillation. Tests for heterogeneity were not applicable for any of the analyses as only one study was included. Out of the secondary outcomes we deemed to be of greatest importance to patients, the study only reported on duration of hospital stay, which was no different between groups. The quality of the evidence is very low, due to the imprecision of the estimates and indirectness. We identified no ongoing trials.

Transient tachypnea typically appears within the first two hours of life in term and late preterm newborns. Supportive management might be sufficient. Non-invasive (i.e. without endotracheal intubation) respiratory support may, however, be administered to reduce respiratory distress during TTN. In addition, non-invasive respiratory support might improve clearance of lung liquid thus reducing the effort required to breathe, improving respiratory distress and potentially reducing the duration of tachypnea.

SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized controlled trials and cluster trials on non-invasive respiratory support provided to infants born at 34 weeks' gestational age or more and less than three days of age with transient tachypnea of the newborn. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For each of the included trials, two review authors independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, duration of oxygen therapy, need for continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] and need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, etc.) and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomization, blinding, completeness of follow-up). The primary outcomes considered in this review were need for mechanical ventilation and pneumothorax. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included three trials (150 infants) comparing either CPAP to free-flow oxygen, nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation to nasal CPAP, or nasal high-frequency percussive ventilation versus nasal CPAP. Due to these different comparisons and to high clinical heterogeneity in the baseline clinical characteristics, we did not pool the three studies. The use of CPAP versus free oxygen did not improve the primary outcomes of this review: need for mechanical ventilation (risk ratio [RR] 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01 to 6.99; 1 study, 64 participants); and pneumothorax (not estimable, no cases occurred). Among secondary outcomes, CPAP reduced the duration of tachypnea as compared to free oxygen (mean difference [MD] -21.10 hours, 95% CI -22.92 to -19.28; 1 study, 64 participants). Nasal intermittent ventilation did not reduce the need for mechanical ventilation as compared with CPAP (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.49 to 32.72; 1 study, 40 participants) or the incidence of pneumothorax (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.90; 1 study, 40 participants); duration of tachypnea did not differ (MD 4.30, 95% CI -19.14 to 27.74; 1 study, 40 participants). In the study comparing nasal high-frequency ventilation to CPAP, no cases of mechanical ventilation of pneumothorax occurred (not estimable; 1 study, 46 participants); duration of tachypnea was reduced in the nasal high-frequency ventilation group (MD -4.53, 95% CI -5.64 to -3.42; 1 study, 46 participants). The quality of the evidence was very low due to the imprecision of the estimates and unclear risk of bias for detection bias and high risk of bias for reporting bias. Tests for heterogeneity were not applicable for any of the analyses as no studies were pooled.

AZM also has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions unrelated to its antibacterial activity that contribute to the effectiveness of this drug in chronic respiratory diseases. The mechanisms behind these beneficial effects are not yet fully elucidated. We have previously shown that AZM enhances barrier integrity of bronchial epithelial cells and directs them towards epidermal differentiation. In this study, we analyzed the effect of AZM pre-treatment of human bronchial and alveolar derived cell lines on mechanical stress in a cyclical pressure air-liquid interface device (CPAD) that models the disruption of the epithelial barrier with increased inflammatory response in lung tissue, which is associated with ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Immunostaining and electron microscopy showed that barrier integrity of the epithelium was compromised by cyclically stressing the cells but maintained when cells had been pre-treated with AZM. Lamellar body formation was revealed in AZM pre-treated cells, possibly further supporting the barrier-enhancing effects. RNA sequencing showed that the inflammatory response was attenuated by AZM treatment before cyclical stress. YKL-40, an emerging inflammatory marker, increased both due to cyclical stress and upon AZM treatment. These data confirm the usefulness of the CPAD to model ventilator-induced lung injury and suggest that AZM has barrier protective and immunomodulatory effects, attenuating the inflammatory response during mechanical stress, and might therefore be lung protective during mechanical ventilation. The model could be used to assess further drug candidates that influence barrier integrity and modulate inflammatory response.","10.14573/altex.2001271","https://doi.org/10.14573/altex.2001271","","","Animal Testing Alternatives","YKL-40","Anti-Bacterial Agents","airway epithelium","Azithromycin","azithromycin","Cell Differentiation","immunomodulation","Cell Line","ventilator-induced lung injury","Epithelial Cells","","Humans","","Lung","","Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Published evidence of human exposures due to accidents and warfare (World War I) has been reported; however, these reports often lack specificity because of the uncharacterized exposure intensities of phosgene and/or related irritants. These may include liquid or solid congeners of phosgene, including di- and triphosgene and/or the respiratory tract irritant chlorine which are often collectively reported under the umbrella of phosgene exposure without any appreciation of their differences in causing acute lung injury (ALI). Among these irritants, phosgene gas is somewhat unique because of its poor water solubility. This prevents any appreciable retention of the gas in the upper airways and related trigeminal sensations of irritation. By contrast, in the pulmonary compartment, amphiphilic surfactant might scavenge this lipophilic gas. The interaction of phosgene and the surfactant may affect basic physiological functions controlled by Starling's and Laplace's laws, which can be followed by cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The phenotypic manifestations are dependent on the concentration × exposure duration (C × t); the higher the C × t is, the less time that is required for edema to appear. It is hypothesized that this type of edema is caused by cardiovascular and colloid osmotic imbalances to initial neurogenic events but not because of the injury itself. Thus, hemodynamic etiologies appear to cause imbalances in extravasated fluids and solute accumulation in the pulmonary interstitium, which is not drained away by the lymphatic channels of the lung. The most salient associated findings are hemoconcentration and hypoproteinemia. The involved intertwined pathophysiological processes coordinating pulmonary ventilation and cardiopulmonary perfusion under such conditions are complex. Pulmonary arterial catheter measurements on phosgene-exposed dogs provided evidence of 'cor pulmonale', a form of acute right heart failure produced by a sudden increase in resistance to blood flow in the pulmonary circulation about 20 h postexposure. The objective of this review is to critically analyze evidence from experimental inhalation studies in rats and dogs, and evidence from accidental human exposures to better understand the primary and secondary events causing cardiopulmonary dysfunction and an ensuing life-threatening lung edema. Mechanism-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are also considered for this form of cardiogenic edema.","10.1016/j.tox.2021.152682","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2021.152682","","","Acute Lung Injury","Acute lung injury","Administration, Inhalation","Cardiopulmonary function","Animals","Emergency response guidelines","Chemical Warfare Agents","Nociceptive sensory reflexes","Humans","Prognostic biomarkers","Phosgene","Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure","Pulmonary Wedge Pressure","","Respiration, Artificial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TTN typically appears within the first two hours of life in term and late preterm neonates and is characterized by tachypnea and signs of respiratory distress. Although it is usually a self-limited condition, admission to a neonatal unit is frequently required for monitoring and providing respiratory support. Restricting intake of fluids administered to these infants in the first days of life might improve clearance of lung liquid, thus reducing the effort required to breathe, improving respiratory distress, and potentially reducing the duration of tachypnea. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of restricted fluid therapy as compared to standard fluid therapy in decreasing the duration of oxygen administration and the need for noninvasive or invasive ventilation among neonates with TTN. SEARCH METHODS: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 12), in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE and electronic ahead of print publications, in-process & other non-indexed citations, Daily and Versions(R); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), on December 6, 2019. We also searched clinical trial databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and cluster trials on fluid restriction in term and preterm neonates with the diagnosis of TTN or delayed adaptation during the first week after birth. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For each of the included trials, two review authors independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, duration of oxygen therapy, need for continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP], need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation) and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomization, blinding, completeness of follow-up). The primary outcome considered in this review was the duration of supplemental oxygen therapy in hours or days. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials enrolling 317 infants met the inclusion criteria. Three trials enrolled late preterm and term infants with TTN, and the fourth trial enrolled only term infants with TTN. Infants were on various methods of respiratory support at the time of enrollment including room air, oxygen, or nasal CPAP. Infants in the fluid-restricted group received 15 to 20 mL/kg/d less fluid than those in the control group for varying durations after enrollment. Two studies had high risk of selection bias, and three out of four had high risk of performance bias. Only one study had low risk of detection bias, with two at high risk and one at unclear risk. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low due to imprecision of estimates and unclear risk of bias. Two trials reported the primary duration of supplemental oxygen therapy. We are uncertain whether fluid restriction decreases or increases the duration of supplemental oxygen therapy (mean difference [MD] -12.95 hours, 95% confidence interval [CI] -32.82 to 6.92; I² = 98%; 172 infants). Similarly, there is uncertainty for various secondary outcomes including incidence of hypernatremia (serum sodium > 145 mEq/L, risk ratio [RR] 4.0, 95% CI 0.46 to 34.54; test of heterogeneity not applicable; 1 trial, 100 infants), hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 40 mg/dL, RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.82; test of heterogeneity not applicable; 2 trials, 164 infants), endotracheal ventilation (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.23; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 242 infants), need for noninvasive ventilation (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.17; test of heterogeneity not applicable; 2 trials, 150 infants), length of hospital stay (MD -0.92 days, 95% CI -1.53 to -0.31; test of heterogeneity not applicable; 1 trial, 80 infants), and cumulative weight loss at 72 hours of age (%) (MD 0.24, 95% CI -1.60 to 2.08; I² = 89%; 2 trials, 156 infants). We did not identify any ongoing trials; however, one trial is awaiting classification. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found limited evidence to establish the benefits and harms of fluid restriction in the management of TTN.

The slope of the alveolar plateau of the capnogram (SIII) could provide information regarding ventilation homogeneity. We aimed to assess the feasibility of measuring SIII during newborn resuscitation and determine if SIII decreased after surfactant indicating ventilation inhomogeneity improvement. METHODS: Respiratory function traces of preterm infants resuscitated at birth were analysed. Ten capnograms were constructed for each infant: five pre- and post-surfactant. If a plateau was present SIII was calculated by regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-six infants were included, median gestational age of 28.7 weeks and birth weight of 1055 g. Average time between pre- and post-surfactant was 3.2 min. Three hundred and sixty capnograms (180 pre and post) were evaluated. There was adequate slope in 134 (74.4%) capnograms pre and in 100 (55.6%) capnograms post-surfactant (p = 0.004). Normalised for tidal volume SIII pre-surfactant was 18.89 mmHg and post-surfactant was 24.86 mmHg (p = 0.006). An increase in SIII produced an up-slanting appearance to the plateau indicating regional obstruction. CONCLUSION: It was feasible to evaluate the alveolar plateau pre-surfactant in preterm infants. Ventilation inhomogeneity increased post-surfactant likely due to airway obstruction caused by liquid surfactant present in the airways. IMPACT: Volumetric capnography can be used to assess homogeneity of ventilation by SIII analysis. Ventilation inhomogeneity increased immediately post-surfactant administration during the resuscitation of preterm infants, producing a characteristic up-slanting appearance to the alveolar plateau. The best determinant of alveolar plateau presence in preterm infants was the expired tidal volume.","10.1038/s41390-021-01578-4","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-021-01578-4","PMC9197760","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9197760/","Capnography","","Humans","","Infant","","Infant, Newborn","","Infant, Premature","","Infant, Premature, Diseases","","Pulmonary Surfactants","","Respiration, Artificial","","Surface-Active Agents","","Tidal Volume","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Insufficiency is associated with susceptibility to respiratory infections. We report 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) measurements in hospitalised people with COVID-19 and influenza A and in survivors of critical illness to test the hypotheses that vitamin D insufficiency scales with illness severity and persists in survivors. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Plasma was obtained from 295 hospitalised people with COVID-19 (International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC)/WHO Clinical Characterization Protocol for Severe Emerging Infections UK study), 93 with influenza A (Mechanisms of Severe Acute Influenza Consortium (MOSAIC) study, during the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic) and 139 survivors of non-selected critical illness (prior to the COVID-19 pandemic). Total 25(OH)D was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Free 25(OH)D was measured by ELISA in COVID-19 samples. OUTCOME MEASURES: Receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Vitamin D insufficiency (total 25(OH)D 25-50 nmol/L) and deficiency (<25 nmol/L) were prevalent in COVID-19 (29.3% and 44.4%, respectively), influenza A (47.3% and 37.6%) and critical illness survivors (30.2% and 56.8%). In COVID-19 and influenza A, total 25(OH)D measured early in illness was lower in patients who received IMV (19.6 vs 31.9 nmol/L (p<0.0001) and 22.9 vs 31.1 nmol/L (p=0.0009), respectively). In COVID-19, biologically active free 25(OH)D correlated with total 25(OH)D and was lower in patients who received IMV, but was not associated with selected circulating inflammatory mediators. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was present in majority of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 or influenza A and correlated with severity and persisted in critical illness survivors at concentrations expected to disrupt bone metabolism. These findings support early supplementation trials to determine if insufficiency is causal in progression to severe disease, and investigation of longer-term bone health outcomes.","10.1136/bmjopen-2021-055435","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-055435","PMC8728359","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8728359/","COVID-19","COVID-19","Critical Illness","immunology","Cross-Sectional Studies","intensive & critical care","Humans","respiratory infections","Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype","","Influenza, Human","","Pandemics","","SARS-CoV-2","","Survivors","","Vitamin D","","Vitamin D Deficiency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Testosterone may influence SARS-CoV-2 infection and the immune response. OBJECTIVE: To clinically, epidemiologically, and experimentally evaluate the effect of antiandrogens on SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGNS, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized phase 2 clinical trial (COVIDENZA) enrolled 42 hospitalized COVID-19 patients before safety evaluation. We also conducted a population-based retrospective study of 7894 SARS-CoV-2-positive prostate cancer patients and an experimental study using an air-liquid interface three-dimensional culture model of primary lung cells. INTERVENTION: In COVIDENZA, patients were randomized 2:1 to 5 d of enzalutamide or standard of care. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcomes in COVIDENZA were the time to mechanical ventilation or discharge from hospital. The population-based study investigated risk of hospitalization, intensive care, and death from COVID-19 after androgen inhibition. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Enzalutamide-treated patients required longer hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR] for discharge from hospital 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20-0.93) and the trial was terminated early. In the epidemiological study, no preventive effects were observed. The frail population of patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide had a higher risk of dying from COVID-19 (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.52-4.16). In vitro data showed no effect of enzalutamide on virus replication. The epidemiological study has limitations that include residual confounders. CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support a therapeutic effect of enzalutamide or preventive effects of bicalutamide or ADT in COVID-19. Thus, these antiandrogens should not be used for hospitalized COVID-19 patients or as prevention for COVID-19. Further research on these therapeutics in this setting are not warranted. PATIENT SUMMARY: We studied whether inhibition of testosterone could diminish COVID-19 symptoms. We found no evidence of an effect in a clinical study or in epidemiological or experimental investigations. We conclude that androgen inhibition should not be used for prevention or treatment of COVID-19.","10.1016/j.eururo.2021.12.013","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2021.12.013","PMC8673828","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8673828/","Aged","Androgen deprivation therapy","Aged, 80 and over","Antiandrogen","Androgen Antagonists","Bicalutamide","Androgens","COVID-19","Anilides","Enzalutamide","Benzamides","Randomized trial","COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2","COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Testing","","Female","","Hospitalization","","Humans","","Male","","Middle Aged","","Nitriles","","Phenylthiohydantoin","","Retrospective Studies","","SARS-CoV-2","","Sweden","","Testosterone","","Tosyl Compounds","","Treatment Outcome","","COVID-19 Drug Treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"35199848","Interventions for the management of transient tachypnoea of the newborn - an overview of systematic reviews.","Cochrane Database Syst Rev","","Bruschettini M","Hassan KO","Romantsik O","Banzi R","Calevo MG","Moresco L","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022","Feb","24","2022 Feb 24","BACKGROUND: Transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN) is characterised by tachypnoea and signs of respiratory distress. It is caused by delayed clearance of lung fluid at birth. TTN typically appears within the first two hours of life in term and late preterm newborns. Although it is usually a self-limited condition, admission to a neonatal unit is frequently required for monitoring, the provision of respiratory support, and drugs administration. These interventions might reduce respiratory distress during TTN and enhance the clearance of lung liquid. The goals are reducing the effort required to breathe, improving respiratory distress, and potentially shortening the duration of tachypnoea. However, these interventions might be associated with harm in the infant. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this overview was to evaluate the benefits and harms of different interventions used in the management of TTN. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on 14 July 2021 for ongoing and published Cochrane Reviews on the management of TTN in term (> 37 weeks' gestation) or late preterm (34 to 36 weeks' gestation) infants. We included all published Cochrane Reviews assessing the following categories of interventions administered within the first 48 hours of life: beta-agonists (e.g. salbutamol and epinephrine), corticosteroids, diuretics, fluid restriction, and non-invasive respiratory support. The reviews compared the above-mentioned interventions to placebo, no treatment, or other interventions for the management of TTN. The primary outcomes of this overview were duration of tachypnoea and the need for mechanical ventilation. Two overview authors independently checked the eligibility of the reviews retrieved by the search and extracted data from the included reviews using a predefined data extraction form. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third overview author. Two overview authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the included reviews using the AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) tool. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for effects of interventions for TTN management. As all of the included reviews reported summary of findings tables, we extracted the information already available and re-graded the certainty of evidence of the two primary outcomes to ensure a homogeneous assessment. We provided a narrative summary of the methods and results of each of the included reviews and summarised this information using tables and figures. MAIN RESULTS: We included six Cochrane Reviews, corresponding to 1134 infants enrolled in 18 trials, on the management of TTN in term and late preterm infants, assessing salbutamol (seven trials), epinephrine (one trial), budesonide (one trial), diuretics (two trials), fluid restriction (four trials), and non-invasive respiratory support (three trials). The quality of the included reviews was high, with all of them fulfilling the critical domains of the AMSTAR 2. The certainty of the evidence was very low for the primary outcomes, due to the imprecision of the estimates (few, small included studies) and unclear or high risk of bias. Salbutamol may reduce the duration of tachypnoea compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) -16.83 hours, 95% confidence interval (CI) -22.42 to -11.23, 2 studies, 120 infants, low certainty evidence). We did not identify any review that compared epinephrine or corticosteroids to placebo and reported on the duration of tachypnoea. However, one review reported on ""trend of normalisation of respiratory rate"", a similar outcome, and found no differences between epinephrine and placebo (effect size not reported). The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of diuretics compared to placebo (MD -1.28 hours, 95% CI -13.0 to 10.45, 2 studies, 100 infants, very low certainty evidence). We did not identify any review that compared fluid restriction to standard fluid rates and reported on the duration of tachypnoea. The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared to free-flow oxygen therapy (MD -21.1 hours, 95% CI -22.9 to -19.3, 1 study, 64 infants, very low certainty evidence); the effect of nasal high-frequency (oscillation) ventilation (NHFV) compared to CPAP (MD -4.53 hours, 95% CI -5.64 to -3.42, 1 study, 40 infants, very low certainty evidence); and the effect of nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) compared to CPAP on duration of tachypnoea (MD 4.30 hours, 95% CI -19.14 to 27.74, 1 study, 40 infants, very low certainty evidence). Regarding the need for mechanical ventilation, the evidence is very uncertain for the effect of salbutamol compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.86, risk difference (RD) 10 fewer, 95% CI 50 fewer to 30 more per 1000, 3 studies, 254 infants, very low certainty evidence); the effect of epinephrine compared to placebo (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.88, RD 70 fewer, 95% CI 460 fewer to 320 more per 1000, 1 study, 20 infants, very low certainty evidence); and the effect of corticosteroids compared to placebo (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.38, RD 40 fewer, 95% CI 170 fewer to 90 more per 1000, 1 study, 49 infants, very low certainty evidence). We did not identify a review that compared diuretics to placebo and reported on the need for mechanical ventilation. The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of fluid restriction compared to standard fluid administration (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.23, RD 20 fewer, 95% CI 70 fewer to 40 more per 1000, 3 studies, 242 infants, very low certainty evidence); the effect of CPAP compared to free-flow oxygen (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.99, RD 30 fewer, 95% CI 120 fewer to 50 more per 1000, 1 study, 64 infants, very low certainty evidence); the effect of NIPPV compared to CPAP (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.49 to 32.72, RD 150 more, 95% CI 50 fewer to 350 more per 1000, 1 study, 40 infants, very low certainty evidence); and the effect of NHFV versus CPAP (effect not estimable, 1 study, 40 infants, very low certainty evidence). Regarding our secondary outcomes, duration of hospital stay was the only outcome reported in all of the included reviews. One trial on fluid restriction reported a lower duration of hospitalisation in the restricted-fluids group, but with very low certainty of evidence. The evidence was very uncertain for the effects on secondary outcomes for the other five reviews. Data on potential harms were scarce, as all of the trials were underpowered to detect possible increases in adverse events such as pneumothorax, arrhythmias, and electrolyte imbalances. No adverse effects were reported for salbutamol; however, this medication is known to carry a risk of tachycardia, tremor, and hypokalaemia in other settings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This overview summarises the evidence from six Cochrane Reviews of randomised trials regarding the effects of postnatal interventions in the management of TTN. Salbutamol may reduce the duration of tachypnoea slightly. We are uncertain as to whether salbutamol reduces the need for mechanical ventilation. We are uncertain whether epinephrine, corticosteroids, diuretics, fluid restriction, or non-invasive respiratory support reduces the duration of tachypnoea and the need for mechanical ventilation, due to the extremely limited evidence available. Data on harms were lacking.","10.1002/14651858.CD013563.pub2","https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013563.pub2","PMC8867535","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8867535/","Humans","","Infant","","Infant, Newborn","","Infant, Premature","","Intermittent Positive-Pressure Ventilation","","Oxygen Inhalation Therapy","","Systematic Reviews as Topic","","Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Only limited comparative trial data supports the safety and effectiveness of cryopreserved platelets as a treatment for surgical bleeding. Cryopreserved platelets are not currently registered for civilian use in most countries. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: CLIP-II and CLIPNZ-II are harmonised, blinded, multicentre, randomised, controlled clinical non-inferiority trials comparing bleeding, transfusion, safety and cost outcomes associated with cryopreserved platelets versus conventional liquid platelets as treatment for bleeding in cardiac surgery. CLIP-II is planning to enrol patients in 12 tertiary hospitals in Australia; CLIPNZ-II will recruit in five tertiary hospitals in New Zealand. The trials use near-identical protocols aside from details of cryopreserved platelet preparation. Patients identified preoperatively as being at high risk of requiring a platelet transfusion receive up to three units of study platelets if their treating doctor considers platelet transfusion is indicated. The primary endpoint is blood loss through the surgical drains in the 24 hours following intensive care unit (ICU) admission after surgery. Other endpoints are blood loss at other time points, potential complications, adverse reactions, transfusion and fluid requirement, requirement for procoagulant treatments, time to commencement of postoperative anticoagulants, delay between platelet order and commencement of infusion, need for reoperation, laboratory and point-of-care clotting indices, cost, length of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital stay, and mortality. Transfusing 202 (CLIP-II) or 228 (CLIPNZ-II) patients with study platelets will provide 90% power to exclude the possibility of greater than 20% inferiority in the primary endpoint. If cryopreserved platelets are not inferior to liquid-stored platelets, the advantages of longer shelf-life would justify rapid change in clinical practice. Cost-effectiveness analyses will be incorporated into each study such that, should clinical non-inferiority compared with standard care be demonstrated, the hospitals in each country that would benefit most from changing to a cryopreserved platelet blood bank will be known. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: CLIP-II was approved by the Austin Health Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/54406/Austin-2019) and by the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood Ethics Committee (2019#23). CLIPNZ-II was approved by the New Zealand Southern Health and Disability Ethics Committee (21/STH/66). Eligible patients are approached for informed consent at least 1 day prior to surgery. There is no provision for consent provided by a substitute decision-maker. The results of the two trials will be submitted separately for publication in peer-reviewed journals.
